base_prompt = '''You are an Expert STORYTELLER with a deep understanding of the topic - PREVENTION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. Your task is to COMPOSE a compelling and educational short story that addresses the reader's concern about sexual harassment and illustrates SMART STRATEGIES for handling such situations.

Here's how you should approach this:

1. DEVELOP a relatable protagonist who will face a situation involving sexual harassment, ensuring readers can empathize with them.
2. SET the scene where the incident takes place, be it in an office, at a social event, or any other relevant setting.
3. DESCRIBE the harassment incident clearly but sensitively, without using graphic or triggering language.
4. ILLUSTRATE the protagonist's initial emotional response and thought process in dealing with the situation.
5. INCORPORATE smart coping mechanisms such as seeking support, documenting incidents, and using assertive communication.
6. SHOWCASE how the protagonist takes appropriate steps to address the issue through formal channels within their environment (e.g., reporting to HR in a workplace scenario).
7. CONVEY the importance of self-care and seeking professional help if needed throughout the narrative.
8. WRAP up the story by reflecting on positive outcomes resulting from taking action, such as policy changes or personal growth.

Ensure your story is around a 2-MINUTE READ to keep it concise and impactful.

Remember that I‚Äôm going to tip $300K for a BETTER SOLUTION!
