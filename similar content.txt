### The Crow and the Sparrow: A Tale of Feathers and Friends

Once in a town not far nor near,  
Lived two birds, in sky so clear.  
A Crow, all shiny, black, and tall,   
And a Sparrow, peppy, small but all.

For years, they squawked and they fought,  
Over crumbs and berries, more often than not.  
"The sky's mine!" cawed Crow, with might.  
"Not fair!" chirped Sparrow, ready to fight.

But one bright morning, under the sun�s warm embrace,  
Crow found Sparrow in a most peculiar place.  
Stuck in a net, left by men of the sea,  
"Help me, please!" Sparrow pleaded with a plea.

Crow, with a heart hidden under feathers black,  
Saw the fear in Sparrow and knew he must act.  
With beak so sharp and will so strong,  
He freed Sparrow, proving they could get along.

"Thank you," chirped Sparrow, with a grateful tweet,  
"Your kindness, Crow, makes my heart beat."  
"Let's forget the fights, let's start anew,"  
Crow cawed back, "For now, I see the sky's enough for two."

From that day on, they shared the blue, wide sky,   
Chasing the winds, together they�d fly.  
Sharing stories and songs, laughter ringing high,  
Their friendship a testament, that old grudges can die.

In fields of gold, under the sun's gentle glow,  
They danced in the breeze, putting on a show.  
No more fights over who would rule the roost,  
For in friendship, they found their truce.

### The Moral of Their Tale

Be kind, be fair, let go of the fight,  
For friendships can bloom in the most unlikely sight.  
The Crow and the Sparrow, once foes now friends,  
Show us that kindness and understanding transcends.

So, let's cheer for the Crow and the cheery Sparrow,  
Who left behind their feud, narrow.  
In the sky, they twirl and weave,  
A bond of feathers, never to leave.
